/**
 * Product events: things a user did that no other table records — hitting a
 * paywall, picking a plan, being flagged by risk checks. They land in the
 * `user_event` table and show in the admin user timeline (and to agents via
 * `users_timeline`) next to orders, credits and tasks.
 *
 * Register every kind here before using it:
 * - `tone`: timeline dot — green (money in), red (failure / risk), amber (the
 *   user moving toward paying), gray (default).
 * - `client: true` lets the browser report it with `track()` from
 *   `@/lib/track`. Leave it off for anything the user must not be able to
 *   fake (risk flags, anything money-related) and record those on the server
 *   with `recordEvent()` from `@/modules/events/service`.
 *
 * Label: add `admin.user_detail.timeline_<kind>` to messages/{en,zh}.json
 * (falls back to the kind itself).
 *
 * This file is imported by the browser bundle: no server imports here.
